In this part the task I've done is to change the program into an OOP style and the art 1-4, it has the right pattern but still doesn't look as beautiful as the picture shown in the example.

The task I haven't done is art 5-8. I haven't done it because I couldn't manage the time good enough to do the remaining part.
