In this part the task I've done is to change the program into an OOP style and the art 1-4, it has the right pattern but still doesn't look as beautiful as the picture shown in the example.

The task I haven't done is art 5-8. I haven't done it because I couldn't manage the time good enough to do the remaining part.

### How to use the program:
When you run the program it will ask you to choose which art you want to generate and after you enter it the program will generate the art for you. But unfortunately in this version of the program can only generate art 1-4
